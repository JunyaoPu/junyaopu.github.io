I'm interested in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) because they demonstrate outstanding generative abilities, producing high-quality synthetic images, videos, music, and computer code. The concept of GANs was first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and has since been applied to various domains, including computer vision, audio, and text generation.

GANs train two neural networks simultaneously: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network's objective is to generate synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator network's purpose is to distinguish between real and generated data.
