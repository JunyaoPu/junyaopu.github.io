Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a revolutionary approach to generating synthetic data that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. The concept of GANs was introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and has since then been applied to various domains such as computer vision, audio, and text generation.

GANs work by training two neural networks simultaneously, a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network's goal is to generate synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator network's goal is to determine whether the data it receives is real or generated.
