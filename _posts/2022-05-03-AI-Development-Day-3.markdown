# Motivation  
The history of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s, when neuroscientists and computer scientists first started investigating the idea of constructing machine learning models that would resemble the structure and function of the human brain. Today, ANNs are applied in various fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a subclass of ANNs, primarily utilized for image processing, owing to the strength of the convolutional layer. Notable CNN architectures include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet.
