# Introduction  
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves finding and locating objects within images or videos. Deep learning is often used to tackle object detection challenges by using neural networks to identify objects and draw bounding boxes around them. Some popular deep learning models for object detection include Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and RetinaNet. YOLO is considered to be the best object detection model for edge devices, such as the NVIDIA Jetson family, due to its simple implementation and fast inference speed.
