This is my personal project where I trained a Unet model on the PASCAL VOC Dataset (2012) using an AWS EC2 cloud server, and deployed the semantic segmentation model on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier hardware with ROS2 C/C++ and TensorRT C/C++, delivering 55 frames per second with input RGB images from a Logitech webcam.

# Setup
- AWS access for EC2 (p3.2xlarge)

- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier (JetPack 4.5)

- ROS2 installed (Eloquent)

- Logitech C920 Webcam HD Pro

- A monitor 

# Workflow
The training phase was executed on an AWS EC2 cloud server utilizing PyTorch. An Onnx file was utilized as a connector to transfer the trained model to the deployment hardware. The deployment phase was performed on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier using ROS2 and TensorRT, as the C/C++ programming language was selected for its exceptional speed for input pre-processing and output post-processing.

# PASCAL VOC Dataset
The PASCAL VOC (Visual Object Classes) dataset also includes annotations for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is the task of labeling every pixel in an image with a corresponding class label, such as "person," "car," or "background."
Here are total 21 classes including the background in the PASCAL VOC Dataset (2012).
