This is my personal project where I trained a YOLO v4 model using the COCO dataset on an AWS EC2 cloud server. I then deployed the YOLO object detection model on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier with ROS2 platform, achieving 60 frames per second with an input resolution of 512x512 RGB images.

# Setup
- AWS access for EC2 

- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier

- ROS2 installed 

# Task
The training phase was executed on an AWS EC2 cloud server utilizing PyTorch. An Onnx file was utilized as a connector to transfer the trained model to the deployment hardware. The deployment phase was performed on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier using ROS2 and TensorRT C, as the C programming language was selected for its exceptional speed performance in comparison to Python.
