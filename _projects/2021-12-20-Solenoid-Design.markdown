# Research Goal
To build a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulator for TRASE MRI, you would need to have a strong understanding of the TRASE MRI method, as well as experience with programming for GPU acceleration. This would likely involve using a programming language such as CUDA to parallelize the simulation, as well as optimizing the simulation for performance on a GPU. Additionally, you would need to have experience with MRI image reconstruction techniques, and be familiar with the software and libraries commonly used in this field.
