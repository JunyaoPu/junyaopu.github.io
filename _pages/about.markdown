I am a machine learning engineer. I obtained my M.Sc in electrical engineering in 2022, my graduate research mainly focuses on deep learning algorithms, and tensor decomposition methods. I am interested in AI research & development, I had excellent work experiences with real-time AI vision for off-highway autonomous systems on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier series.
