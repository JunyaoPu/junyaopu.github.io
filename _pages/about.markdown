I am a physicist and engineer. I obtained my B.Sc (Honours) in physics in 2019 and M.Sc in electrical engineering in 2022. My graduate research mainly focuses on deep learning algorithms, numerical simulation, and tensor decomposition methods. I had experience with AI vision projects, high-performance computing (HPC) with NVIDIA CUDA C, and multiple medical imaging research such as MRI and OCT.
