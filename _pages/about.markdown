I am an AI/ML engineer. 

I joined <a href="https://northstar-robotics.com/">Northstar Robotics<a/> in 2021 as a Machine Learning Engineer, leading the development of AI vision using segmentation and object detection algorithms. In 2022, I joined <a href="https://jcatechnologies.com/">JCA Technologies<a/> as a Perception Engineer, constructing AI vision pipelines for off-highway autonomous systems.

I earned my M.Sc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Manitoba, with a focus on deep learning and tensor decomposition methods. My graduate research involved designing and implementing a convolutional neural network using tensor-train decomposition, as detailed in my thesis: <a href="https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/handle/1993/36582">Design and implementation of a convolutional neural network using tensor-train decomposition<a/>

Skills:<br />
PyTorch/Python, C/C++, CUDA C/C++, TensorRT, NVIDIA Jetson Platform, ROS2.


Graduate-Level Course:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (Grade A)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Estimation Theory (Grade A)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Advanced Signal Processing (Grade A)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Digital Signal Processing (Grade A)
