I am a machine learning engineer. 

For my study, I obtained my M.Sc in electrical engineering from the University of Manitoba, my graduate research was focused on deep learning algorithms, and tensor decomposition methods. 

For my work, I joined Northstar robotics in 2021 as a machine learning engineer, I was leading the AI vision development based on segmentation and object detection algorithms. I joined JCA technologies as a preception engineer in 2022, I am currently constructing our own AI vision pipeline for off-highway autonomous systems.
