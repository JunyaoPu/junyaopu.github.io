I am a AI/ML engineer. 

For my study, I obtained my M.Sc in electrical engineering from the University of Manitoba, my graduate research focuses on deep learning algorithms, and tensor decomposition methods. Please see my thesis <a href="https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/handle/1993/36582">Design and implementation of a convolutional neural network using tensor-train decomposition<a/> for details.

For my work, I joined <a href="https://northstar-robotics.com/">Northstar Robotics<a/> in 2021 as a machine learning engineer, I was leading the AI vision development based on segmentation and object detection algorithms. I joined <a href="https://jcatechnologies.com/">JCA Technologies<a/> as a perception engineer in 2022, I am currently constructing our own AI vision pipeline for off-highway autonomous systems.
