I am a AI/ML engineer. 

I joined <a href="https://northstar-robotics.com/">Northstar Robotics<a/> in 2021 as a Machine Learning Engineer, leading the development of AI vision using segmentation and object detection algorithms. In 2022, I joined <a href="https://jcatechnologies.com/">JCA Technologies<a/> as a Perception Engineer, constructing AI vision pipelines for off-highway autonomous systems.

I earned my M.Sc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Manitoba, with a focus on deep learning and tensor decomposition methods. My graduate research involved designing and implementing a convolutional neural network using tensor-train decomposition, as detailed in my thesis.<a href="https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/handle/1993/36582">Design and implementation of a convolutional neural network using tensor-train decomposition<a/>
